# Inflector

Inflector provides an API for forming the plurals of nouns. It was introduced in a blog
 post by Tom White in 2006:
 [Pluralization](https://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2006/07/pluralization.html).

API usage is described in the [API docs](https://tomwhite.github.io/inflector).
